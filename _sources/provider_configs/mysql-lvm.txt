MySQL LVM Backup Plugin Configuration
=====================================

[mysql-lvm]
-----------
**snapshot-size** = <size-in-MB>

    The size of the snapshot itself. By default it is 20% of the size of  the 
    MySQL LVM mount or the remaining free-space in the Volume Group (if there 
    is less than 20% available) up to 15GB. If snapshot-size is defined, the 
    number represents the size of the snapshot in megabytes.

**snapshot-name** = <name>

    The name of the snapshot, the default being the name of the MySQL LVM 
    volume + "_snapshot" (ie Storage-MySQL_snapshot)
    
**snapshot-mountpoint** = <path>    
    
    Where to mount the snapshot. By default a randomly generated directory 
    under /tmp is used.

**innodb-recovery** = yes | no

    Whether or not to run an InnoDB recovery operation. This avoids needing 
    to do so during a restore, though will make the backup process itself 
    take longer.

**lock-tables** = yes | no
    
    Whether or not to run a FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK to grab various
    bits of information (such as the binary log name and position). Disabling
    this requires that binary logging is disabled and InnoDB is being used
    exclusively. Otherwise, it is possible that the backup could contain
    crashed tables.
    
**extra-flush-tables** = yes | no
    
    Whether or not to run a FLUSH TABLES before running the full 
    FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK. Should make the FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK
    operation a bit faster.

[tar]
-----

**exclude** = <list-of-patterns>

    This can be used to exclude particular patterns in the MySQL datadir. The
    patterns are mapped directly to a tar --exclude option.  By default we
    will exclude the 'mysql.sock' file but other common files that may be
    worth excluding are binary logs or relay logs that don't need included
    in the main backup.

[mysqld]
--------

These option control the mysqld bootstrap process that is started when
``innodb-recovery`` is enabled.

**mysqld-exe** = path  (default: first of mysqld on path or /usr/libexec/mysqld)

    Specify the path to find the mysqld server binary that should be used.

**user** = <string> (default: "mysql")

    User to run mysqld as.

**innodb-buffer-pool-size** = <size> (default: 128M)

    Size of the InnoDB buffer pool.  This should be significantly smaller than
    the main instance's buffer pool to avoid swapping.

**tmpdir**

    tmpdir setting to use for the bootstrap mysql process
