Usage and Implementation Overview
=================================

Because Holland is very pluggable, it may first seem a bit confusing when
it comes to configuring Holland to do something useful. Out of the box,
Holland is designed to backup MySQL databases using the mysqldump plugins.
This is the simplest setup, and may be sufficient for most people. However, 
others may wish to have more fine-grained control over their backups and/or 
use another method other than mysqldump.

For instance, one can configure a backup set to backup certain databases
using mysqldump, others using the mysql-lvm plugins etc. All this is done
by a mix of pluginss and backup-sets.

Backup-Sets
^^^^^^^^^^^

Each backup-set implements exactly one plugins and will inherit the default
values of that plugins. These values can be overridden to adjust the
behavior of the backup set. This includes defining what databases or tables
to include (or exclude) in the backup, the type of compression used (if 
any), what locking method to use, among other things.

Providers
^^^^^^^^^

Providers essentially provide a backup service for use in a backup set. 
As of Holland 1.0.6, there are 5 backup plugins:

* mysqldump

    Uses the ``mysqldump`` utility to backup databases.

* mysql-lvm/mysqldump-lvm

    Backup MySQL databases using LVM snapshots which allows for near lockless 
    or fully lockless (when transactional engines are used) backups.
    Holland's mysql-lvm package includes two LVM plugins:
    
    + mysql-lvm - archives the MySQL datadir on a snapshot using tar
    + mysqldump-lvm - runs mysqldump against a temporary mysql instance 
                      running on the snapshot. This supports all the same
                      options as the normal mysqldump plugin but can
                      reduce locking incurred by mysqldump by using the
                      snapshot data.
 
* xtrabackup

    Backup MySQL databases using Percona's xtrabackup InnoDB hot backup 
    utility. This works well for heavy InnoDB deployment particularly where
    LVM or other filesystem snapshots do not.
    Currently this is limited to performing streaming backups with tar4ibd
    which may not be suitable for all environments.

* pgdump

    Backup Postgres databases using the pg_dump utility.

As Holland is a framework, it can actually backup most anything as long
as there is a plugins for it. This includes things that have nothing to do 
with databases. The idea is to present an easy to use and clear method
of backing up and restoring backups no matter the source.

If the current plugins do not meet your needs and you have idea for new ways
